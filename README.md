# dummy_treatments
Repository for student-group of "Technogie und Wissenschaft"

This Project is related to the HAPS PI Project
see https://github.com/AnujaHari87/hapsweakestlinkpi/tree/refactor_structure

In the main project, there are 20 participants in one session. In the Weakest Link game Subsession (including the Treatments), these participants are reshuffled over five rounds according to the perfect stranger paradigm.
The extensive introduction, dependent variables, and handling of 20 participants will complicate testing. Therefore, you should start with this dummy project, which allows you to focus on the treatments.

First, as a team, you should develop a blueprint for the oTree treatment page. This page should include the following widgets: one for the text/introduction, one for the Jitsi video meeting, and one for the treatment itself.

Consider how much space each element will need on the webpage to avoid scrolling - everything should be visible on the page simultaneously.
Once the blueprint is ready, you can begin developing the four treatments. We recommend continuing in separate branches to develop the treatments. For this, use "git checkout -b NEW_BRANCHNAME". To track the branch in the remote repository, you need to set an upstream using "git push -u origin NEW_BRANCHNAME".

The treatments are:

- Mental Contrasting
- Coordination Rules
- Mental Contrasting with Coordination Rules
- personal values via Spidergraph
